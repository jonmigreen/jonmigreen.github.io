    <h1>History of the Web</h1>
    <p>
        The World Wide Web ("WWW" or "The Web") is a global information medium which users can access via computers
        connected to the Internet. The term is often mistakenly used as a synonym for the Internet itself, but the Web
        is a service that operates over the Internet, just as email and Usenet also do. The history of the Internet
        dates back significantly further than that of the World Wide Web.</p>

    <p>The hypertext portion of the Web in particular has an intricate intellectual history; notable influences and
        precursors include Vannevar Bush's Memex, IBM's Generalized Markup Language, and Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu.

    <h2 id="browsers">Browsers</h2>

    <p>Initially, a web browser was available only for the NeXT operating system. This shortcoming was discussed in
        January 1992, and alleviated in April 1992 by the release of Erwise, an application developed at the Helsinki
        University of Technology, and in May by ViolaWWW, created by Pei-Yuan Wei, which included advanced features such
        as embedded graphics, scripting, and animation. ViolaWWW was originally an application for HyperCard. Both
        programs ran on the X Window System for Unix. In 1992, the first tests between browsers on different platforms
        were concluded successfully between buildings 513 and 31 in CERN, between browsers on the NexT station and the
        X11-ported Mosaic browser.</p>
    <p>Students at the University of Kansas adapted an existing text-only hypertext browser, Lynx, to access the web.
        Lynx was available on Unix and DOS, and some web designers, unimpressed with glossy graphical websites, held
        that a website not accessible through Lynx wasn't worth visiting.</p>
    <p>The first Microsoft Windows browser was Cello, written by Thomas R. Bruce for the Legal Information Institute at
        Cornell Law School to provide legal information, since access to Windows was more widespread amongst lawyers
        than access to Unix. Cello was released in June 1993.</p>
    <p>The Web was first popularized by Mosaic, a graphical browser launched in 1993 by Marc Andreessen's team at the
        National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (UIUC).
        The origins of Mosaic date to 1992. In November 1992, the NCSA at the University of Illinois (UIUC) established
        a website. In December 1992, Andreessen and Eric Bina, students attending UIUC and working at the NCSA, began
        work on Mosaic with funding from the High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative, a US-federal
        research and development program. Andreessen and Bina released a Unix version of the browser in February 1993;
        Mac and Windows versions followed in August 1993.[14] The browser gained popularity due to its strong support of
        integrated multimedia, and the authors’ rapid response to user bug reports and recommendations for new features.
    </p>
    <p>After graduation from UIUC, Andreessen and James H. Clark, former CEO of Silicon Graphics, met and formed Mosaic
        Communications Corporation in April 1994 to develop the Mosaic Netscape browser commercially. The company later
        changed its name to Netscape, and the browser was developed further as Netscape Navigator.</p>

    <p>In May 1994, the first International WWW Conference, organized by Robert Cailliau,[10][40] was held at CERN;[41]
        the conference has been held every year since. In April 1993, CERN had agreed that anyone could use the Web
        protocol and code royalty-free; this was in part a reaction to the concern caused by the University of
        Minnesota's announcement that it would begin charging license fees for its implementation of the Gopher
        protocol.</p>

    <p>In September 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of
        Technology with support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the European Commission.
        It comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality
        of the Web. Berners-Lee made the Web available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The W3C decided that
        its standards must be based on royalty-free technology, so they can be easily adopted by anyone.</p>
